## Status

* Timeline
  * 2022-12-06: Suggested chain start time: `2022-12-06T19:00:00.000000000Z`
  * 2022-12-06: Spawn time: `2022-12-06T16:00:00.000000000Z`
  * 2022-12-05: Proposal 53 voting period ends
  * 2022-12-02: Proposal 53 goes into voting period
  * 2022-12-02: Genesis file without CCV state is generated

`hunterbank` will launch as a consumer chain through a governance proposal in the `provider` chain. Read the [Consumer Chain Start Process](/docs/Consumer-Chain-Start-Process.md) page for more details about the workflow.

The following items will be included in the proposal:
* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file that the proposer has made available for review.
  * This "fresh" genesis file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV states after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary hash
* Spawn time
  * Even if the proposal passes, the CCV states will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

## Chain Data

### Binary

The binary published in this repo is the `hunterbankd` binary built using the `blockhunters-org/hunterbank` repo tag [v1.0.0](https://github.com/blockhunters-org/hunterbank/releases/tag/v1.0.0). You can generate the binary following the [Get Started section](https://github.com/blockhunters-org/hunterbank/tree/v1.0.0#get-started). 

### Verify Binary Checksum.
Binary checksums can differ based on many things to include go, libc, and make versions. To get a consistent checksum you can use something like docker to verify.

* [Linux amd64 build](hunterbankd)
* Version: `v1.0.0`
* SHA256: `1f383407ce33f171e831ba8d24dd7c0d368e7c0d90c514405e2c061be8e36c6f`

Example of using a volume mount to get the binary outside of the container onto your ubuntu server.
  ```
  # run on your ubuntu server
  # use the `realpath` for the volume mount.
  docker run -v /home/ubuntu/go/bin:/root/go/bin -it --entrypoint /bin/bash ghcr.io/strangelove-ventures/checksum:v.0.1.0
  ```
  ```
  # run inside docker container.
  git clone https://github.com/blockhunters-org/hunterbank.git
  cd hunterbank
  git fetch
  git checkout v1.0.0
  make install
  sha256sum ~/go/bin/hunterbankd
  ```
expected return `1f383407ce33f171e831ba8d24dd7c0d368e7c0d90c514405e2c061be8e36c6f`

Now, verify the checksum on your local ubuntu server
  ```
  # run on your ubuntu server
  sha256sum /home/ubuntu/go/bin/hunterbankd
  ```
expected return `1f383407ce33f171e831ba8d24dd7c0d368e7c0d90c514405e2c061be8e36c6f`

### Genesis file

**The genesis file for Interchain Security consumer chains must include the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state generated by the provider chain _after_ the spawn time is reached.**

Final genesis file **with CCV state**: **`pending spawn time`**
- SHA256: `pending spawn time`
- Validators must replace their `config/genesis.json` file with this one before running the binary.

The genesis file with was generated using the following settings:

* Chain ID: `hunterbank-1`
* Denom: `uhunt`
* Signed blocks window: `"8640"`
* Genesis accounts were added to provide funds for a faucet and a relayer that will be run by the testnet coordinators.
* Genesis file **without CCV state**: [`hunterbank-fresh-genesis.json`](hunterbank-fresh-genesis.json), SHA256: `8639f693c9b7bb3428d7e6e697fc8eac105de36aadedd58901199298abba66f2`
  * **This is provided only for verification, this is not the genesis file validators should be running their nodes with.**

## Endpoints

* **p2p persistent peers : `16e2d7c6cd29b289e278a7c2220e0c4fbbc9d04a@65.21.237.83:16656,4c7296bd9508ffbd7aebfc9c71e60362685d6779@198.244.167.63:26656`**
* These peers represent the `BlockHunters ðŸŽ¯`validator. We are accepting `250` inbound peeers, but please consider sharing your peers in discord, or create a PR to [`peers.txt`](peers.txt)

* Please keep in mind that any validator that does not come online after 67% of the voting power is up and running, is likely to be slashed for downtime, potentially resulting in being jailed (the `signed_blocks_window` parameter is set to `8640`).

## Join via Bash Script

On the node machine:
- Copy the `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` files for your validator.
  - **These should be the same ones as the ones from your provider node**.
- Run one of the following scripts:
  - hunterbank service: [hunterbank-init.sh](hunterbank-init.sh)
  - Cosmovisor service: [hunterbank-init-cv.sh](hunterbank-init-cv.sh)
- Wait until the spawn time is reached and the genesis file with the CCV states is available.
- Overwrite the genesis file with the one that includes the CCV states.
  - The default location is `$HOME/.hunterbank/config/genesis.json`.
- Enable and start the service:
  - hunterbank
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable hunterbank
    sudo systemctl start hunterbank
    ```
  - Cosmovisor
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable cv-hunterbank
    sudo systemctl start cv-hunterbank
    ```
- To follow the log, use:
  - hunterbank: `journalctl -fu hunterbank`
  - Cosmovisor: `journalctl -fu cv-hunterbank`
- If the log does not show up right away, run `systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
