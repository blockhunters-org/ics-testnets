## Status

* Timeline
  * 2022-11-30: Suggested chain start time: `2022-11-30T19:00:00.000000000Z`
  * 2022-11-30: Spawn time: `2022-11-30T16:00:00.000000000Z`
  * 2022-11-28: Proposal 18 voting period ends
  * 2022-11-26: Proposal 18 goes into voting period
  * 2022-11-26: Genesis file without CCV state is generated

`hunterverse` will launch as a consumer chain through a governance proposal in the `provider` chain. Read the [Consumer Chain Start Process](/docs/Consumer-Chain-Start-Process.md) page for more details about the workflow.

The following items will be included in the proposal:
* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file that the proposer has made available for review.
  * This "fresh" genesis file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV states after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary hash
* Spawn time
  * Even if the proposal passes, the CCV states will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

## Chain Data

### Binary

The binary published in this repo is the `hunterversed` binary built using the `blockhunters-org/hunterverse` repo tag [v1.0.0](https://github.com/blockhunters-org/hunterverse/releases/tag/v1.0.0). You can generate the binary following the [Get Started section](https://github.com/blockhunters-org/hunterverse/tree/v1.0.0#get-started). 

### Genesis file

**The genesis file for Interchain Security consumer chains must include the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state generated by the provider chain _after_ the spawn time is reached.**

Final genesis file **with CCV state**: **`pending spawn time`**
- SHA256: `pending spawn time`
- Validators must replace their `config/genesis.json` file with this one before running the binary.

The genesis file with was generated using the following settings:

* Chain ID: `hunterverse-1`
* Denom: `uhunt`
* Signed blocks window: `"8640"`
* Genesis accounts were added to provide funds for a faucet and a relayer that will be run by the testnet coordinators.
* Genesis file **without CCV state**: [`hunterverse-fresh-genesis.json`](hunterverse-fresh-genesis.json), SHA256: `969ab94d0fa4020700758a9e7d5e0eae9dfa907ffcb437df41eb6eb76ae5e03e`
  * **This is provided only for verification, this is not the genesis file validators should be running their nodes with.**

## Endpoints

* **p2p persistent peers : `16e2d7c6cd29b289e278a7c2220e0c4fbbc9d04a@65.21.237.83:16656,4c7296bd9508ffbd7aebfc9c71e60362685d6779@198.244.167.63:26656`**
* These peers represent the `BlockHunters ðŸŽ¯`validator. We are accepting `250` inbound peeers, but please consider sharing your peers in discord, or create a PR to [`peers.txt`](peers.txt)

* Please keep in mind that any validator that does not come online after 67% of the voting power is up and running, is likely to be slashed for downtime, potentially resulting in being jailed (the `signed_blocks_window` parameter is set to `8640`).

## Join via Bash Script

On the node machine:
- Copy the `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` files for your validator.
  - **These should be the same ones as the ones from your provider node**.
- Run one of the following scripts:
  - hunterverse service: [hunterverse-init.sh](hunterverse-init.sh)
  - Cosmovisor service: [hunterverse-init-cv.sh](hunterverse-init-cv.sh)
- Wait until the spawn time is reached and the genesis file with the CCV states is available.
- Overwrite the genesis file with the one that includes the CCV states.
  - The default location is `$HOME/.hunterverse/config/genesis.json`.
- Enable and start the service:
  - hunterverse
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable hunterverse
    sudo systemctl start hunterverse
    ```
  - Cosmovisor
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable cv-hunterverse
    sudo systemctl start cv-hunterverse
    ```
- To follow the log, use:
  - hunterverse: `journalctl -fu hunterverse`
  - Cosmovisor: `journalctl -fu cv-hunterverse`
- If the log does not show up right away, run `systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
